Use the interactive figure tools or the xlim and ylim functions to zoom in on the data points near the origin. Do you think it's possible to make a reasonably accurate model that uses these two features to distinguish these three letters?

A classification model is a partitioning of the space of predictor variables into regions, in which each region is assigned one of the output classes. In this simple example with two predictor variables, you can visualize these regions in the plane.

knnmodel

Did changing the number of neighbors change the prediction on the test observation? Which prediction is better? How can you evaluate your model from its predictions?

You can obtain predictions for multiple observations by passing a matrix or table of new data to the predict function. What letters does the model predict for the training data?

predictions = predict(knnmodel,features)

You can concatenate categorical arrays to see the predictions and true classes side-by-side.

[predictions features.Character]

Is this a fair comparison, given that the model was built from this data in the first place? In the next activity, you'll use test data to evaluate the performance of the model.
